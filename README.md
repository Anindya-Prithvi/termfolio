Everyone makes a portfolio. I made a termfolio.

## Termfolio
A revolutionary keyboard centric portfolio. Ofcourse, this is the very first release and has very limited features... However, the aesthetics are amazing.

## How to use:
Replace my name with yours (everywhere except credits lol). Update `thejson.tsx` with your stuff. Deploy on vercel app or github pages.

## How to flex:
Send it to CLI haters ✔️

## Changelog
### (v1.0.1) Enabled visitor metrics
- Each page visit will now be counted
